# slack-redirect

https://slack.nycmesh.net

## Purpose

Uses github pages to redirect the `slack` subdomain to slack.

## Updating the URL

Every now and then, the invite link for slack needs to be updated. When that happens do the following:

1. Update the url in [index.html](./index.html)
2. Merge your change to the default branch (`master`).
